# About Me
- I'm a **4th-year Systems Engineering student**
- Developing a ~~unstable~~ mildly chaotic passion for coding and problem-solving (depends on the day)
- Fluent in **English** and **Spanish**

> *"Debugging is just me versus me. Usually, I lose. Skill issue."*

## Tech Stack
- **C#** / **.NET** (Core & Framework)
- **ASP.NET Core** (Web APIs & MVC)
- **Entity Framework** (Code First, Migrations)
- **LINQ** (because sometimes, elegance matters)
- **SQL Server** / **SQLite**
- **Clean Architecture** (for maintainable & scalable solutions)

---

Feel free to connect, collaborate, or refactor something together (no promises on the debugging).
